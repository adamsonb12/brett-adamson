                    <p> There are 5 Teaching Assisted Language Learning (TALL) applications at the Missionary Training Center (MTC). They are web applications built completely by us in the Technology department, and are used to help LDS missionaries become proficient in the language they are learning. Languages range from Spanish to Mandarin, and more continue to be added to the database. </p>
                    <p> Tall Admin Tool (TAT) is the TALL application controlling all content in the other TALL web applications. I've owned TAT since it's beginning, planning, designing, and writing user stories as well as monitoring its progress of being built and pushed into production by our programming team. It is built in Angular, IOS, and Andriod. </p>
                    <p> TAT provides TALL administration to filter, edit, and protect the content in their respective applications. It allows language experts to review content, edit it, and delete it, or add new content. It is the backbone of all other TALL applications.</p>

                    <p> I fell in love with coding! Ever since that first course, I constantly seek out more ways to practice my develoment skills. I've learned various languages attending Brigham Young University and I still take OneMonth.com's courses in responsive web development, cyber security, and other fields to push myself as much as possible. </p>
